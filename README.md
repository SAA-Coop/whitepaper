## Terms
### **SAA**: Sequential Accumulation Artisan
"Code is an excutable thought, with the right maintaining it also become perpetually excutable."

From developer persective,
Code(Software) is like potential energy. It can be stored and accumulated over time. It could be exercised at any time to create kinetic energy, which is the result of the code being executed. It can manipulate reality, creating tangible results from abstract ideas many times over and over. Argeably, Code is the closest thing to perpetual motion machine that we have in the world of technology.

Coding basically is an art of sequential accumulation, where each line of code builds upon the previous one whether it might take higher form of abstruction like functional programming, but as we live in a space-time universe, it goes down into the sequntial form ultimately. As accumulation continues, the code becomes more complex and powerful, allowing for the creation of intricate systems and applications. The shortcoming is that it becomes harder and harder to maintain as the codebase grows. Thus, if you can increase the complextity of the codebase while keeping it maintainable, you are doing the art of Sequential Accumulation.

the word "Sequential" is carefully pick to unbounded, to go beyond the "Code". Since the code is what you write down into a computer. but to create an end-to-end value. Code become a part of system or even become system itself. With loops, feedbacks, interactions between systems internally and externally, humans and interfaces, code alone is not enough to complete the circle.
Sequential describes generic building blocks of any systems. It includes
- Bussiness Logics
- Human Interfaces
- Code
- Human Behaviors
- Realworld Environment

"Artisan" is an expression, a declaration that we are putting the soul aka messages and intentions into what we do. Sometimes, we disconnects with people to connect with inner self. we are not driven by deadlines or result-oriented goals. We are driven purely by process-oriented goals aka [passion or ฉันทะ](https://th.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%97_4).
